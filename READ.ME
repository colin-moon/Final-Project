My project is a an escape the maze type game where the player as to avoid the walls and the flying objects, and navigate through a labrynth. For this project I was inspired by old arcade games that were known for being quite simple, but also very challenging. 
I started working by creating the the character and the movemnt. This was pretty simple as I was able to use some of my previous work and just tweak some of the settings. Then, I had to plan out the maze which took a while as I needed to come up with a path for the player to be able to escape and then create all of the dead ends. My first iteration was way too simple which was really frustrating as I spent a lot of time on it but I essentially had to restart. My second (current) attempt was way better and I'm I restarted because I think it came out great. Then, I needed to code the maze into the game. I used rectangles to create the walls. I started by making rings with equal space between. I then cut out the exit path by splitting the rectangles in two and/or three different pieces. Once I had the exit path, I created all of the other breaks in the rectangles for the diverving paths and then put in the extra walls to create all of the dead ends.
